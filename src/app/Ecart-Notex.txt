----------------------------E cart Front-End Notes---------------------
1. create a new folder E-cart
2. inside that folder create a new angular project => ng new ecart-frontend
3. install 3rd party libraries
          ->MdBootstrap => npm i mdb-angular-ui-kit
          -> font-awesome install =>npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
          -> google fonts => paste @import from google fonts in style.css

4.Lazy Loading   
  Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript components when a specific
  route is activated. It improves application load time speed by splitting the application into many 
  bundles. When the user navigates by the app, bundles are loaded as needed.

  Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load times. We must use the
  class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, and the decorator uses a metadata object 
  that defines the module.       

5. create a new module in Angular (here we create product module for implementing lazy loading)
    =>   ng g m products --route products --module app.module    

6. cretae component in lazy loading module(products module)
 => ng g c products/allProducts
 => ng g c products/viewProducts
 => ng g c products/wishlist
 => ng g c products/cart

7. components that not included in lazy loading 
  =>  ng g c header
  =>  ng g c footer
  =>  ng g c pageNotFound 

8. set up path for components
   ->  localhost4200- all products path ==> localhost4200/allProducts
